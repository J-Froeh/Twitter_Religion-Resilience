# Twitter_Religion-Resilience
This repository features code from the research project "Digital Religious Communication and the Facilitation of Resilient Faith: A Study of the Twitter Activity of Ecumenical and Social Justice-Oriented Groups during the COVID-19 Pandemic" to replicate the results or adapt to your own study. The study was kindly supported by the [VolkswagenStiftung](https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/de) (Volkswagen Foundation) and part of the project "The role of transcultural semantics and symbols for resilience during the Corona pandemic – a hermeneutic approach to historical and intercultural expressions of severe crisis".

## Data availablity
The data used for the study cannot be shared publicly according to [Twitter's Developer Policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy) as well as according to the GDPR since it might contain sensitive data. Therefore, the code provided here allows replicating the exact dataset used for the study regarding all official accounts. Additionally, both datasets (including the randomized one) can be requested directly from the study's authors and will be distributed in the form of Tweet-ID's.

## This project consists of...
The project provides code according to the study mentioned above. This includes 
1. python-scripts for data-collection and pre-cleaning
2. jupyter notebooks for data cleaning
3. jupyter notebooks for the statistical analysis conducted (communication volume & sentiment)
4. jupyter notebooks for the topic modeling conducted

Additionally, the datasets used for the study can be requested via the project owner.

## Remarks for using the code
### Twitter API v2
The data collection using the python files is based on access to Twitter's academic research API. Access can be requested via 'https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research'. Once access is granted, a token will be provided by Twitter. The token has to be saved as environment variable - the according variable's name then must be 'Scraper.py' and 'Scraper_sample.py' 

### Credits
Credit for the randomization approach in 'Scraper_sample' is due to the following post: https://twittercommunity.com/t/generating-a-random-set-of-tweet-ids/150255. <br>
Also, the topic analysis and the hyperparameter adjustment were based on the paper "Twitter Topic Modeling" by Amin Azad (Azad, Amin, 2020. ‘GitHub: some-labs-24 / data-science’. https://github.com/some-labs-24/data-science).
